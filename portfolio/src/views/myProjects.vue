           What did the client ask you to do? What was the
          briefing? What was the main challenge and measure of success? Did you
          have a certain idea or expectation for the project when you began?

           Anything interesting to share about your process for
          this project? Did you take a unique angle or notice some surprising
          insight? Do you have some early sketches we can see? Why did you
          choose that approach? Ask yourself WHY WHY WHY a thousand times, and
          then answer those questions.
