          Don’t underestimate the curiosity of potential clients. Some would
          love to learn your professional story about how you learned to do
          whatever it is you do as well as any official education/training,
          awards and recognitions you’ve picked up along the way. Don’t be
          afraid to break away from a professional tone to share your thoughts,
          feelings and opinions while you tell your story. You don’t need to
          tell your life story, but you should mention any obstacles you’ve
          overcome in your niche.
